# Memory Profiler - Amazon Q Analysis

## Memory Issue Analysis

The Memory Profiler was used to analyze memory usage patterns in a Python data processing script that works with HDF5 files. The analysis revealed several key issues:

### Observed Memory Behavior

1. **High Memory Retention**: Memory usage spikes during processing and doesn't return to baseline levels.
2. **Oscillating Pattern**: Memory usage shows a cyclical pattern of increases and decreases.
3. **Large Memory Fluctuations**: Memory usage fluctuates by hundreds of megabytes between measurements.

### Memory Statistics

- **Initial RSS**: 8.13 MB
- **Peak RSS**: 1,586.51 MB (approximately 1.59 GB)
- **Final RSS**: 1,402.64 MB (approximately 1.40 GB)
- **Mean RSS**: 1,304.5 MB (approximately 1.30 GB)

## Root Causes

1. **Python's Memory Management**: Python's garbage collector doesn't immediately return all freed memory to the operating system.
2. **Memory Fragmentation**: Repeated allocation and deallocation of large objects leads to memory fragmentation.
3. **Inefficient Data Conversion**: Converting NumPy arrays to Python lists with `.tolist()` creates duplicate data in memory.
4. **Missing Garbage Collection**: No explicit garbage collection after freeing large data structures.

## Implemented Solutions

1. Created an optimized dictionary-based version (`process_data_optimized.py`) that:
   - Processes columns in smaller chunks to reduce peak memory
   - Adds explicit garbage collection at strategic points
   - Uses better resource management with context managers
   - Minimizes data duplication

2. Created a NumPy-based version (`process_data_numpy.py`) that:
   - Uses structured NumPy arrays instead of Python dictionaries
   - Avoids unnecessary type conversions
   - Leverages NumPy's memory-efficient data structures
   - Maintains the same processing logic with better memory efficiency

3. Enhanced the memory monitoring tool to:
   - Create timestamped debug files for comparison
   - Preserve historical data from multiple runs
   - Generate more detailed memory usage visualizations

## Verification

The improvements can be verified by:
1. Running all versions with the memory monitoring tool
2. Comparing memory usage patterns in the generated visualizations
3. Verifying that the functional results remain identical

## Conclusion

The memory issues stemmed primarily from Python's memory management behavior combined with inefficient data handling patterns. Both optimized versions address these issues while maintaining the same functionality, with the NumPy-based approach likely providing the most significant memory efficiency improvements.
